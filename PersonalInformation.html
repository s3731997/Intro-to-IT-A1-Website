    <p>Anna Liu is a first year Uni student with a budding interest in design and technology. Her parents were from Hong Kong but immigrated to Australia to pursue further education. Anna was born in Gippsland, but moved to suburban Melbourne when she was 6. She had also dropped out of public school, and from then on was taught by a private tutor at home. Before starting this subject, she had previously completed two other subjects, Introduction to Game Design and Introduction to Programming, with her getting a High Distinction on the former. She hopes to continue completing subjects and enrol in a Bachelor of IT. She is most fluent in English, but aspires to learn other languages like French, Cantonese and Japanese.</p>

    <p>Annaâ€™s favourite hobby is drawing, which she has been doing since the age of 7. She is also a fan of many different types of media, such as cartoons, anime, video games and webcomics,  and likes to draw fanart or read fanfictions based on them. Some of her favourite pieces of media include Sonic the Hedgehog, Miraculous Ladybug and Studio Ghibli movies.</p>

    <p>She enjoys creating her own characters and stories, and is currently working on a story which she hopes to turn into a webcomic one day. She also wants to learn animation as a way to bring her characters to life. Some other related pastimes include browsing Pinterest for character design and aesthetic references, reading articles on writing and drawing advice, and exploring new genres of music to listen to.</p>

    <p>In addition to art, Anna also likes to explore the fields of psychology, philosophy and theology, as she likes to understand how people think, and to deepen her understanding of the mysteries of life and her relationship with God. To a lesser extent, she also enjoys reading 18th century literature, learning about animals, and researching crimes and how police departments work for her story.</p>
