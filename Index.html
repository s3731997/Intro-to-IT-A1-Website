    <p>Anna Liu is a first year Uni student with a budding interest in design and technology. Her parents were from Hong Kong but immigrated to Australia to pursue further education. Anna was born in Gippsland, but moved to suburban Melbourne when she was 6. She had also dropped out of public school, and from then on was taught by a private tutor at home. Before starting this subject, she had previously completed two other subjects, Introduction to Game Design and Introduction to Programming, with her getting a High Distinction on the former. She hopes to continue completing subjects and enrol in a Bachelor of IT. She is most fluent in English, but aspires to learn other languages like French, Cantonese and Japanese.</p>

    <p>Anna’s favourite hobby is drawing, which she has been doing since the age of 7. She is also a fan of many different types of media, such as cartoons, anime, video games and webcomics,  and likes to draw fanart or read fanfictions based on them. Some of her favourite pieces of media include Sonic the Hedgehog, Miraculous Ladybug and Studio Ghibli movies.</p>

    <p>She enjoys creating her own characters and stories, and is currently working on a story which she hopes to turn into a webcomic one day. She also wants to learn animation as a way to bring her characters to life. Some other related pastimes include browsing Pinterest for character design and aesthetic references, reading articles on writing and drawing advice, and exploring new genres of music to listen to.</p>

    <p>In addition to art, Anna also likes to explore the fields of psychology, philosophy and theology, as she likes to understand how people think, and to deepen her understanding of the mysteries of life and her relationship with God. To a lesser extent, she also enjoys reading 18th century literature, learning about animals, and researching crimes and how police departments work for her story.</p>

<div id="Interest in IT" class="pagecontent">
   <h2>Areas of interest in IT</h2>
   <p>Anna’s main interests in IT are Web Design, UX (User eXperience), UI (User Interface), and Game Design.</p>

   <p>Web Design, UX and UI are interrelated disciplines that focus on easing the connection between human and machine through the use of appealing, consistent and intuitive design
  as well as visual aesthetics that are pleasing to the eye and communicate meaning, identity and emotion to the user or client. They often utilise many principles of art and design, including (but not limited to) composition, use of negative space, colour theory, shape language and contrast. As this world becomes more and more digitised, websites and applications are being used by more and more people to manage various aspects of their daily lives, bringing in the need for more variety and innovation in design for applications and websites to serve a wider range of clients.</p>

  <p>At its core, game design covers a range of principles that use mechanics, rules and systems to make an engaging and challenging experience for the player. Video games in particular require knowledge in a lot of different fields, like programming, 3D/2D art and animation, and tend to have a large team working on them. The video game industry is ever-evolving and constantly changing, with new advancements in hardware and graphics processing technology allowing for even more life-like and realistic simulation. Even in the realm of stylized games, there are endless opportunities to innovate on each genre and its particular elements.</p>

  <h2>Experience with IT</h2>
  <p>While Anna did not have much interest in IT prior to starting university, she had messed around on Scratch (a building-block visual programming language designed for children) though she used it more to create animated movies rather than its intended purpose. Around the age of 15 she started to become interested in game design from watching videos about it on Youtube, which inspired her to take a course from Murdoch University in Game Design. While she did well in the subject, she realised that having prior programming knowledge would have been very helpful, and an invaluable skill. She discovered her passion for UI/UX design while helping her brother with one of his assignments. She currently has a bit of experience with Python and C#, and hopes to learn more about the world of technology and all its different fields.</p>

  <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>

  <p>Anna learned about RMIT from her brother, who is a third year student at RMIT.  He reported having a good experience with the university's learning material and teachers, so when Anna started OUA she considered RMIT as a good option. She decided to take a course there and found the presentation clean and easy to follow. So far Anna has found a lot of subjects that she’s interested in at RMIT, and she is looking forward to enrolling in them as she works towards a Bachelor of IT. </p>

  <h2>Learning Expectations at RMIT</h2>

  <p>As Anna currently does not have much technical knowledge or knows much about how computers work, she would like to broaden her understanding on the subject during her time at RMIT. She would also like to further develop her programming skills and become proficient in multiple programming languages, as well as learning to use other IT tools like GitHub. Managing deadlines and being able to complete projects from start to finish in a timely manner is also important, and Anna hopes that she will be able to develop a good attitude towards work as she takes more subjects.</p>

  <h2>Myers-Briggs Personality test (<a href="https://www.16personalities.com" target="_blank">16Personalities</a>)</h2>

  <p>These are the results of a MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) test that Anna took recently. It shows that Anna’s cognitive preferences can be categorised with 4 letters. </p>

  <h3>INFP-T (Introverted, iNtuition, Feeling, Perceiving,Turbulent)</h3>

  <p>The percentages for each trait can be seen in the screenshot below (“perceiving” is replaced by “prospecting”):</p>

  <img src="images\Screenshot 2022-09-15 104620.png" alt="MBTI results" width="500">

  <p><strong>Mind (Introverted vs Extraverted): </strong>
  <br>This trait determines how we gain mental energy and interact with the world around us.</p>

  <p><strong>Energy (Intuitive vs Sensing): </strong>
  <br>This trait determines where we direct our mental energy and process information.</p>

  <p><strong>Nature (Feeling vs Thinking):</strong>
  <br>This trait determines how we make decisions and manage our emotions.</p>

  <p><strong>Tactics (Perceiving vs Judging):</strong>
  <br>This trait determines how we plan and organise our environment.</p>

  <p><strong>Identity (Turbulent vs Assertive)</strong>
  <br>This trait determines how confident we are in our abilities and decisions.</p>

  <p>Other things noted about Anna’s Myers-Briggs type:</p>

  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Turbulent Mediator (Quiet, Open-minded and Imaginative)</p>

  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Diplomat (Compassionate, Empathetic and Caring feelers)</p>

  <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Constant Improvement (Individualistic and Perfectionist, but also prone to self-doubt)</p>

  <h2>Learning Styles Test <a href="(https://vark-learn.com)" target="_blank">Vark</a></h2>

  <p>This Learning Style Test showcases Anna’s learning preferences. The test was split into 16 multiple-choice questions, with the user allowed to select more than one answer. The answers pertaining to each learning style were tallied up and are displayed in the screenshot below.  </p>

  <img src="images\Screenshot 2022-09-14 111928.png" alt="Learning Styles Test Results" width="200">

  <p>The results indicate that Anna is primarily a <strong>Kinesthetic (13)</strong> learner, followed by <strong>Visual (7)</strong> and <strong>Aural (4)</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Big Five Personality Test <a href="(https://www.truity.com" target="_blank">Truity</a>)</h2>

  <p>This Big Five Personality test measures Anna’s scores on the five major dimensions of personality, commonly abbreviated as OCEAN.</p>

  <p><strong>O</strong>penness. How often someone might think in abstract or complex ways.</p>

  <p><strong>C</strong>onscientiousness. Someone’s ability to exercise self-control or discipline</p>

  <p><strong>E</strong>xtraversion. How often someone seeks stimulation from the outside world</p>

  <p><strong>A</strong>greeableness. Whether someone is cooperative or puts others' needs before their own.</p>

  <p><strong>N</strong>euroticism. How often someone experiences negative emotions or reacts to stress.</p>

  <p>The results of the test are shown in the screenshots below.</p>

  <img src="images\Screenshot 2022-09-15 124909.png" alt="B5-O" width="500">

  <img src="images\Screenshot 2022-09-15 125038.png" alt="B5-N"width="500">

  <p>The results indicate that Anna is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Highly open to new ideas and experiences</li>

    <li>Somewhat disciplined, but tending more towards being distractible</li>

    <li> Introverted and more likely to seek internal stimulus rather than external</li>

    <li>Rather agreeable and willing to cooperate with others</li>

    <li>Very neurotic and more likely to be stressed than an average person</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>What the test results mean for me</h2>

  <p>The results from all of these tests describe me quite well. I have taken the MBTI test multiple times and have gotten a consistent result of INFP-T, which would solidly indicate that I’m a sensitive, introspective and curious person with an active imagination. INFPs tend to be idealistic and can have unrealistic expectations for both themselves and the world, which could cause problems with setting feasible goals. The percentages for each trait are relatively consistent, being in the low 70s, with the exception of Feeling, being at 64%. This is notedly lower than scores from previous attempts, indicating that my logical thinking and feeling processes are starting to balance each other out. </p>

  <p>The Learning Styles test showed that I am predominantly a Kinesthetic learner, which was surprising to me as I had always assumed myself to be an Aural learner. The Big Five test results lined up quite well with the results from the MBTI test, with the only things to note being that my Agreeableness score was lower than expected and my Conscientiousness score was higher than expected, as INFPs are known to be very friendly and compassionate, but also easily distractible. </p>

  <p>The high openness score explains why I would choose to study IT, a field which I had no prior experience or interest in, as I like to try new things and have knowledge in a variety of areas. The relatively high neuroticism score shows that I am prone to overthinking or stressing out, and that I might like to avoid an intensive job. Things I would like to work on are managing my negative emotions, being able to focus for longer periods, having realistic expectations, and using more rationality when making decisions.</p>

  <h2>How these results may influence team behaviour</h2>

  <p>In a team, my abstract and intuition-based way of thinking might allow me to come up with innovative ideas and brainstorm easily, but I could potentially have trouble committing to one idea. Having high openness and agreeableness would make it easy for me to cooperate with others and be flexible with plans, but as an introvert it is also likely for me to withdraw from communication or team meetings. </p>

  <p>Being a kinesthetic learner means that I have to try things out to understand how they work, which may make my learning process a bit slower. While being empathetic could make me a good source of moral support, I’ve noticed that I tend to stress out over deadlines, and can sometimes take criticism badly. </p>

  <h2>Things to take into account when forming a team</h2>

  <p>I have a natural eye for design and aesthetics, and would work best in UI, adding finishing touches and making things visually appealing. I also have very good communication skills and can easily and effectively communicate my ideas. While I am decent at understanding and applying technical concepts, I wouldn’t consider it a strong point and might need some help from my team to bring myself up to their level of understanding. I wouldn’t be good in a leading position, as I tend to follow rather than initiate, but am willing to step up if required.</p>

  <p>(Total word count: 989 words) </p>

  <h2>Overview (100 words) </h2>

  <p>NanoOrbit is a mobile video game where the player is a ship that rotates around the middle of the screen, as opposed to being on the bottom of the screen. In order to win, the player must survive various waves of attack by avoiding projectiles from enemy ships coming from the edges of the screen and shooting down as many of them as possible to get the highest score. It takes the standard bullet-hell genre and puts a positional spin on it. The main goal of this project is entertainment by catering to gamers who want a challenging yet innovative game, as well as training spatial awareness and reflexes. <br>(105 words)</p>

  <h2>Motivation (100) words) </h2>

  <p>The bullet hell genre is a niche and untapped genre in the gaming world, with only a few standout entries like Just Shapes and Beats and Touhou Project. Since this genre hasn’t been oversaturated by the gaming industry, there are endless ways to expand upon the basic mechanics while going in a unique direction. A fair amount of bullet-hell games are on mobile, which indicates that there is a solid market for these types of games on those platforms. Mobile gamers who are looking for something refreshing and challenging will be excited to play this game, and it could help to introduce some newcomers to the genre.
  <br>(107 words)
  </p>

  <h2>Description (500 words)</h2>

  <p>The main game is split into various levels, with each having multiple predetermined waves with certain enemies types and attack patterns, and a boss at the end. At the start of a level the player ship will be on a ring around the centre of the screen. The player can tap and hold on any part of the screen to shoot. They can drag anywhere on the screen and the ship will relative to the finger’s position and rotate around the middle of the screen. </p>

  <p>The player has three health points, and will lose a point if they hit an enemy or projectile. If the player loses all three points they will die and respawn from the end of the last wave. The player can respawn 5 times before having to restart the whole level. </p>

  <p>The objective of the game is to survive each level while destroying as many enemies as possible and taking damage/respawning as little as possible. At the end, the player is ranked on their performance based on the previously mentioned factors.  </p>

  <p>Different types of enemy ships will try to attack the player, each with their own distinctive movement and shooting pattern.  Some examples are enemies with multiple lines of projectiles, enemies with homing shots or enemies that charge into the player and explode. As the level progresses, the waves will become more and more saturated with enemies.</p>

  <p>When an enemy dies, sometimes they will drop a power up, which moves around the screen and  must be shot by the player until it breaks. Upon doing so the player will gain whatever shot the enemy had for a short period of time. If the power up has not been collected after 30 seconds it will move off the edge of the screen.</p>

  <p>When an enemy dies, sometimes they will drop a power up, which moves around the screen and  must be shot by the player until it breaks. Upon doing so the player will gain whatever shot the enemy had for a short period of time. If the power up has not been collected after 30 seconds it will move off the edge of the screen.</p>

  <p>As the player destroys more enemies, a burst gauge will fill up. When it’s full, the player can tap the gauge to unleash a shock wave that destroys all enemies on screen.</p>

  <p>The boss fight at the end of each level is a bigger version of a certain enemy type, using similar but more dangerous attacks, and will be positioned in the middle of the screen with the player rotating around it. The player needs to deal enough damage to the boss to deplete its health bar and complete the level.</p>

  <p>While other modes and more levels could be added in future updates, the majority of the game’s content is in the levels. The game is intended to be free-to-play, but there will be in-app purchases for extra respawns or power-ups that can be activated in the levels, which are not necessary to complete the game. In-game currency, daily objectives and customization options for the player’s ship could also be added in a future update.</p>
