  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>Anna Liu is a first year Uni student with a budding interest in design and technology. Her parents were from Hong Kong but immigrated to Australia to pursue further education. Anna was born in Gippsland, but moved to suburban Melbourne when she was 6. She had also dropped out of public school, and from then on was taught by a private tutor at home. Before starting this subject, she had previously completed two other subjects, Introduction to Game Design and Introduction to Programming, with her getting a High Distinction on the former. She hopes to continue completing subjects and enrol in a Bachelor of IT. She is most fluent in English, but aspires to learn other languages like French, Cantonese and Japanese.</p>

  <p>Anna’s favourite hobby is drawing, which she has been doing since the age of 7. She is also a fan of many different types of media, such as cartoons, anime, video games and webcomics,  and likes to draw fanart or read fanfictions based on them. Some of her favourite pieces of media include Sonic the Hedgehog, Miraculous Ladybug and Studio Ghibli movies.</p>

  <p>She enjoys creating her own characters and stories, and is currently working on a story which she hopes to turn into a webcomic one day. She also wants to learn animation as a way to bring her characters to life. Some other related pastimes include browsing Pinterest for character design and aesthetic references, reading articles on writing and drawing advice, and exploring new genres of music to listen to.</p>

  <p>In addition to art, Anna also likes to explore the fields of psychology, philosophy and theology, as she likes to understand how people think, and to deepen her understanding of the mysteries of life and her relationship with God. To a lesser extent, she also enjoys reading 18th century literature, learning about animals, and researching crimes and how police departments work for her story.</p>


 <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
 <h2>Areas of interest in IT</h2>
 <p>Anna’s main interests in IT are Web Design, UX (User eXperience), UI (User Interface), and Game Design.</p>

 <p>Web Design, UX and UI are interrelated disciplines that focus on easing the connection between human and machine through the use of appealing, consistent and intuitive design
as well as visual aesthetics that are pleasing to the eye and communicate meaning, identity and emotion to the user or client. They often utilise many principles of art and design, including (but not limited to) composition, use of negative space, colour theory, shape language and contrast. As this world becomes more and more digitised, websites and applications are being used by more and more people to manage various aspects of their daily lives, bringing in the need for more variety and innovation in design for applications and websites to serve a wider range of clients.</p>

<p>At its core, game design covers a range of principles that use mechanics, rules and systems to make an engaging and challenging experience for the player. Video games in particular require knowledge in a lot of different fields, like programming, 3D/2D art and animation, and tend to have a large team working on them. The video game industry is ever-evolving and constantly changing, with new advancements in hardware and graphics processing technology allowing for even more life-like and realistic simulation. Even in the realm of stylized games, there are endless opportunities to innovate on each genre and its particular elements.</p>

<h2>Experience with IT</h2>
<p>While Anna did not have much interest in IT prior to starting university, she had messed around on Scratch (a building-block visual programming language designed for children) though she used it more to create animated movies rather than its intended purpose. Around the age of 15 she started to become interested in game design from watching videos about it on Youtube, which inspired her to take a course from Murdoch University in Game Design. While she did well in the subject, she realised that having prior programming knowledge would have been very helpful, and an invaluable skill. She discovered her passion for UI/UX design while helping her brother with one of his assignments. She currently has a bit of experience with Python and C#, and hopes to learn more about the world of technology and all its different fields.</p>

<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>

<p>Anna learned about RMIT from her brother, who is a third year student at RMIT.  He reported having a good experience with the university's learning material and teachers, so when Anna started OUA she considered RMIT as a good option. She decided to take a course there and found the presentation clean and easy to follow. So far Anna has found a lot of subjects that she’s interested in at RMIT, and she is looking forward to enrolling in them as she works towards a Bachelor of IT. </p>

<h2>Learning Expectations at RMIT</h2>

<p>As Anna currently does not have much technical knowledge or knows much about how computers work, she would like to broaden her understanding on the subject during her time at RMIT. She would also like to further develop her programming skills and become proficient in multiple programming languages, as well as learning to use other IT tools like GitHub. Managing deadlines and being able to complete projects from start to finish in a timely manner is also important, and Anna hopes that she will be able to develop a good attitude towards work as she takes more subjects.</p>
